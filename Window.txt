Before you, there is a window. 
When you look through it, you see a balcony, from which a ladder leads
further down. However, the ladder is not long enough to reach the bottom,
and at some point, you will have to jump. 
To get to the balcony, you need to somehow break the window glass. 
Look for an object that will come in handy.
