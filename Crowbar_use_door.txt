You are using a crowbar. 
You are attempting to open the door by breaking the lock. You succeed.
The door is opening...

But wait... 
The door is starting to close. 
Something is not right...

You quickly block the door with the crowbar and squeeze through the remaining gap. 
You did it. 
You have escaped outside. 

You have won the game.
